### Hi, I'm Sean 👋

I'm an AI researcher and entrepreneurial engineer. My goal is to make progress towards AGI and to work on long-term research products that make people's lives better.

- 🧠 I'm currently an AI researcher at [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain/). I do machine learning research in vision, language, and robotics.
- 🤖 I was previously an early ML engineer at [The Everyday Robot Project](https://x.company/projects/everyday-robots/), which graduated from [X, The Moonshot Factory (formerly Google X)](https://x.company/).
- 👓 I used to work on augmented reality with [Project Tango](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tango_(platform)).
- 🏄 I enjoy California and the many outdoor opportunities that it offers.

If any of this resonates with you, feel free to [reach out](mailto:sean@kirmani.ai). I'd love to chat. 🙂
