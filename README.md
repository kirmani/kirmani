### Hi, I'm Sean 👋

I'm an AI research scientist. My goal is to make progress towards AGI and to work on long-term research that make people's lives better.

- 🧠 I'm currently at [OpenAI](https://www.openai.com/).
- 🤖 I was previously a research scientst at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/). Before that, I worked on perception at [Google\[x\] Robotics](https://x.company/projects/everyday-robots/).
- 🏄 I enjoy California and the many outdoor opportunities that it offers.

If any of this resonates with you, feel free to [reach out](mailto:sean@kirmani.ai). I'd love to chat. 🙂
